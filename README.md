# Project Description

This project is dedicated to enhancing the aesthetic appeal and organization of the Zotero note editor, aimed at providing a more pleasant and efficient note-taking experience for researchers and academic workers. The script introduces subtle yet effective improvements, focusing on readability and layout organization within Zotero.

## Key Features

- **Markdown Text Indentation**: Offers improved indentation for Markdown text, making the notes clearer and easier to navigate.

- **Header Differentiation**: Adjusts the styling for first, second, and third-level headings, providing better visual separation and helping users quickly identify different sections.

- **Stylized Block Quotes**: Integrates a light grey background for block quotes, subtly distinguishing referenced materials or important quotes within notes.

- **Expanded Margin Space**: Increases the margin space for a less crowded and more reader-friendly interface. It's particularly useful for Zotero users who rely on the 'Better Notes' plugin for split-screen note-taking scenarios. These enhancements contribute to a cleaner, more organized note-taking space, aligning with the needs of intensive research documentation.
